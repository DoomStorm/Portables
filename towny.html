	<h3>Towny</h3>
<p>Towny is a great plugin that is used on Another Minecraft Server. Towny is a manager for a Resident-Town-Nation hierarchy. It also provides a block permission manager for a grid-like protection system, which prevents griefing. The grids are based off of minecraft chunks which are 16x16 plots. Each town has a mayor and the mayor has the option to create a nation and become king. A mayor and a king can create assistants to help them run their town, or nation.</p>
<h2 id="toc0"><span><span style="color: orangered">Starting A Town</span></span></h2>
<ul>
<li>To start the fun you will have to put in some time and effort. It costs 20k to create a new town. The best method for making this money is going into the wilderness, mining, and then sell many of the ores that you find.</li>
<li>Once you have enough money you should scout the wilderness and find the area you wish to create your new town in.</li>
<li>Once you have found a nice area, type <strong><span style="color: orangered">/town new (name of town).</span></strong></li>
<li>Now you are a proud owner of your new town</li>
<li>If you wish to add town assistants you can type <strong><span style="color: orangered">/town rank add (playername) assistant</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="toc1"><span><span style="color: orangered">Expanding Your Town</span></span></h2>
<ul>
<li>At first the town you create will only have 4 plots. In order to expand your town you will need to invite more players and increase the residents that live in your town.</li>
<li>You get 4 new plots per each resident you add.</li>
<li>In order to claim new plots, stand in them and type <strong><span style="color: orangered">/town claim</span></strong>
<ul>
<li>If you are having trouble distinguising plot borders you can type <strong><span style="color: orangered">/towny map</span></strong> which will help with plot guidlines</li>
<li>Another command is <strong><span style="color: orangered">/res toggle plotborder</span></strong> which will create a puff of smoke that outlines a plot</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A quick and essay way to get a lot of plots is to join a nation! Joining a nation will give a town a maximum of 280 bonus plots.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="toc2"><span><span style="color: orangered">Plots</span></span></h2>
<ul>
<li>New residents will be looking for plots to build on. A plot is a 16x16 chunk from bedrock to the sky, that will protect whatever is build within its boundaries.</li>
<li>When claiming new plots for your town, they cost $1400. Once a new plot is claimed, you can't unclaim it.
<ul>
<li>You will need to have enough money in your town bank to claim new plots. You can deposit money into the bank by typing <strong><span style="color: orangered">/town deposit (amount).</span></strong> Mayors can withdraw the money by typing <strong><span style="color: orangered">/town withdraw (amount).</span></strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To plut a plot for sale type <strong><span style="color: orangered">/plot fs (amount)</span></strong></li>
<li>To have a resident claim the plot, they must stand in it and type <strong><span style="color: orangered">/plot claim</span></strong>
<ul>
<li>Residents can allow their friends to build and destroy on their plot by typing <strong><span style="color: orangered">/res friend add (playername)</span></strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can also sell plots to players who live in other towns by setting your plot as an embassy. To do so type <strong><span style="color: orangered">/plot set embassy</span></strong></li>
<li>If a resident leaves the town and leaves items in their plot, you can ask a staff member to remove their private chests, and the rest is left to the mayor.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="toc3"><span><span style="color: orangered">Outposts</span></span></h2>
<ul>
<li>If you want to claim an area far away from your town, you can do so by claiming it as an outpost. To claim an outpost type <strong><span style="color: orangered">/town claim outpost</span></strong></li>
<li>The outpost will cost 60k to claim.</li>
<li>If residents want to teleport to the outpost, they have to type <strong><span style="color: orangered">/town outpost</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="toc4"><span><span style="color: orangered">Nations</span></span></h2>
<ul>
<li>If you feel like you have accomplished everything within your town, you can always start a nation!</li>
<li>Buying a nation costs 300k. It also has a $350 daily upkeep.
<ul>
<li>Money has to be in your nation bank in order to pay the daily upkeep. You deposit money by typing <strong><span style="color: orangered">/nation deposit (amount)</span></strong></li>
<li>To withdraw money from the nation bank you can type <strong><span style="color: orangered">/nation withdraw (amount)</span></strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As king you can add new towns to your nation by typing <strong><span style="color: orangered">/nation add town (town name)</span></strong>
<ul>
<li>The more towns you add, the more bonus plots your nation will give out. The maximum plot bonus is 280 plots.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Towny is a great plugin that protects builds as well as enforces a strong community.If you need help with anything to do with towny just ask a staff member and they will be glad to help you out.</p>
