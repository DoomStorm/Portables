	<h3>Ventrilo</h3>
<p><span style="color: azure">Ventrilo is voice chat program that allows the members of our server to speak with one another. Teamspeak is able to run on Windows, Mac, Linux, IOS, and Android. Joining Teamspeak is a great way to get to know the Chosencraft community. Not only is it a ton of fun, but it is also required if you wish to become a staff member on this server. Joining Teamspeak is quick and easy, but just in case you need some help this page will walk you through the installation.</span></p>
<h2 id="toc0"><span><span style="color: orangered">Installation Guide</span></span></h2>
<ol>
<li>The First thing you need to do is to go to <a href="http://ventrilo.com" target="_blank">www.ventrilo.com</a> and download the client.</li>
<li>Once ventrilo is open, a setup wizard will open to help you configure your mic and set up a username.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thankfully Ventrilo is very easy to install, so those two steps should be all you need to successfully install it to your computer. It would be best if you make your username the same as your minecraft name, that way you can be easily identified. You will be given the ability to test your microphone as well as the option to set up a push to talk button.</p>
<h2 id="toc1"><span><span style="color: orangered">Connecting To Another Minecraft Server</span></span></h2>
<ol>
<li>When your Teamspeak is open, click the connections tab at the top of your computer screen.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Connect</strong> option.</li>
<li>Type <strong>anotherminecraftserver.us.to</strong> into the server address bar and click connect.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have followed all of these steps you should now be on the lobby of the Another Minecraft Server Ventrilo server! If you are confused by anything or have done something wrong then ask a staff member, who will be glad to help you out. Feel free to join any of the channels we have and start chatting with the other players of this server. It is a guarantee that you will have many laughs and meet many new friends on Ventrilo. However to keep it a friendly environment there are rules that you must abide by.</p>
<h2 id="toc2"><span><span style="color: orangered">Rules</span></span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Do not swear excessively</li>
<li>Do not troll users</li>
<li>Do not make fun of other's voices</li>
<li>Do not use Teamspeak maliciously</li>
<li>Do not harass other users</li>
<li>No explicit content whatsoever</li>
<li>No Soundboards</li>
</ul>
<p>These rules are enforced by the staff of Another Minecraft Server to ensure that everyone is able to enjoy a friendly environment for all ages. If you notice someone breaking these rules, or if another user is offending you in any way, you can report it to a staff member on Ventrilo, or file a complaint against the user.</p>
<h2 id="toc3"><span><span style="color: orangered">Filing A Complaint</span></span></h2>
<ol>
<li>Right click the user's name and click <strong>Make A Complaint</strong></li>
<li>Fill out the reason for your complaint or concern with the user</li>
<li>Right click their name again and click <strong>Mute Client</strong></li>
<li>Wait for a staff member to handle the rule breaker</li>
</ol>
<p>Congratulations! You are now all experts on using Ventrilo. If you are confused about anything just ask a staff member to assist you, and it should get sorted out no problem. Ventrilo is normally a great environment, but unfortunately there are people who like to break the rules and they must be reported. You will become much more involved in the community by joining our Ventrilo server and it will definitely add to the fun you have! Hope this page helped and we look forward to see more players on Ventrilo.</p>
